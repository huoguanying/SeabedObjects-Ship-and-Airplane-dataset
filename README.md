# SeabedObjects-Ship-and-Airplane-dataset
The SeabedObjects(Ship and Airplane) dataset is currently open for acedemic use now. This open dataset contains 385 ship images and 62 airplane images, and can be used for acedemic purpose.  
Please cite our work in “Underwater Object Classification in Sidescan Sonar Images Using Deep Transfer Learning and Semisynthetic Training Data”, which has been published by IEEE Access, 2020.
We would like to thank L-3 Klein Associates, EdgeTech,Lcocean,Hydro-techMarine,and Tritech for their great support for providing the valuable real sidescan sonar images during the past years, which contributes a lot to the establishment of our dataset.
